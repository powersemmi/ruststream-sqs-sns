---

`ruststream-sqs-sns` will implement the [RustStream](https://github.com/powersemmi/ruststream) broker contract over [`aws-sdk-sqs`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-sdk-sqs) and [`aws-sdk-sns`](https://crates.io/crates/aws-sdk-sns). Handlers, routers, codecs, and middleware come from the framework; this crate supplies the transport - and nothing broker-specific leaks back into the framework.

## Status

**Not implemented yet.** This repository is a scaffold: the workspace, CI, and release plumbing are in place, and the crate is an empty stub. The implementation will target the `ruststream` 0.6 line; the design and scope are tracked in [powersemmi/ruststream#189](https://github.com/powersemmi/ruststream/issues/189).

## Planned surface

- Long-polling subscriber; ack deletes the message, requeue zeroes its visibility, and a delayed retry sets the visibility timeout, so deferred republish is native.
- Visibility extension in the background for handlers that outlive the visibility timeout.
- Dead-lettering via the queue redrive policy; FIFO message group ids mapped onto `Partitioned`.
- SNS as a fan-out publisher only (its delivery targets are queues and HTTP endpoints, not a consumer this crate would own).
- Local-stack endpoint support for development and tests.

The broker contract (lazy startup, the typed connect/shutdown lifecycle, and the optional capability traits) is defined by [`ruststream`](https://crates.io/crates/ruststream) and verified by `ruststream::conformance`, with the suite run against a real broker before release.
