"""Turn a benchmark run into the published results document.

`benches/paired.rs` reports the scenarios it measured and nothing else, because the machine and
the build are not its to describe. This script reads that summary, adds the environment the run
was taken in and the versions it was taken against, and writes the document the documentation
site serves at `benchmarks/results.json`.

The schema is the core's, declared at
https://powersemmi.github.io/ruststream/latest/benchmarks/#publishing-results. This crate
publishes the throughput table alone, each loop as its best and worst round, so the document
declares schema 3.

The broker field names the emulator rather than the service: nothing about a queue in a region
was measured here.

A field the machine does not publish is written as `unknown` rather than guessed: memory speed
comes from the DMI tables, which most systems only let root read.
