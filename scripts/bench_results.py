"""Turn a benchmark run into the published results document.

`benches/paired.rs` reports the scenarios it measured and nothing else, because the machine and
the build are not its to describe. This script reads that summary, adds the environment the run
was taken in and the versions it was taken against, and writes the document the documentation
site serves at `benchmarks/results.json`.

The schema is the core's, declared at
https://powersemmi.github.io/ruststream/latest/benchmarks/#publishing-results: schema 3, each
loop of the comparison as its best, median and worst round, and the `code` section.

`--code` reads the other run instead: the summary `cargo bench -- --output-format=json` writes for
the code-cost benches under `crates/ruststream-sqs-sns-bench/benches`, one JSON object per
benchmark.
It writes the `code` section, one entry per scenario with instructions and allocations per
message plus what starting the service cost once, by the core's method: every scenario is
measured over one delivery, over MESSAGES and over twice MESSAGES, the slope between the last two
is the steady state, and the one-delivery run is the cold start. Either run keeps the section the
other one wrote.

The broker field names the emulator rather than the service: nothing about a queue in a region
was measured here.

A field the machine does not publish is written as `unknown` rather than guessed: memory speed
comes from the DMI tables, which most systems only let root read.
